# First-Repo
I have lots of experience with experimental statistics and data analysis, but never did any programming. 
Just started The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox - first course in the Data Science Specialization through Coursera. 
This is reminding me of using computers with DOS.  Am I showing my age?
